# The Forward Party

The Forward Party is a political movement for people who feel that the legacy parties in the United States do not represent them. It aims to build a new political home that welcomes fresh ideas and constructive debate, moving "Not Left, Not Right, but Forward."

The party's core belief is in putting power back into the hands of the American people to decide what is best for them and their communities. You can learn more about their platform and values on their official website: [https://www.forwardparty.com/](https://www.forwardparty.com/).

The Forward Party focuses on key reforms to improve the American political system, including:
*   Ranked-Choice Voting
*   Nonpartisan Primaries
*   Independent Redistricting Commissions
